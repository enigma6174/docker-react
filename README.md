# docker-react

## Introduction

- A simple React project that demonstrates the CI/CD pipeline with Docker, AWS and Travis CI. 
- I have used Node 14, NPM 6.x and the latest React version to build the hello world web application. 
- The React project is then converted into a production build and the static content is served from NGINX server.
